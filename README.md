## Project overview 

### Tweet Sentiment Extraction : First NLP Analysis
<hr>

[Original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview)

This kernel is about the tutorial how you can start NLP with real world dataset

### Machine learning for beginner : Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients
<hr>

[Orignianl dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/biomechanical-features-of-orthopedic-patients)

This is project is aimded to person who want to start machine learning with Kaggle competition. Acutally **Titatic Competition** is the
most popular kernal for beginner.But I think this dataset would be easiler to understand and handle machine learnining and data analysis.

### Breast Cancer Study 
<hr>

[Original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) 

This study is about different type of tumor with different informations. We'll use different informations as a sub_features or factors to predict if this patient would have a breast canacer. For prediction we'll use **sklearn**. There are algorithms in sklearn but we're going to apply following algorithms 

- SVM
- Randomforest
- DecisionTree
- KNN(K nearest neighbors) 
- Logistic Regression

### Medical Appointment No show
<hr>

[Original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

This project is answering about why so many people didn't show up their Mediacal Appointment. We'll find out what is a fundamental factor of No-show cases and the correlation between different type of factors
