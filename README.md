## Project overview 

> 1. Breast Cancer Study (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) 

This study is about different type of tumor with different informations. We'll use different informations as a sub_features or factors to predict if this patient would have a breast canacer. For prediction we'll use **sklearn**. There are algorithms in sklearn but we're going to apply following algorithms 

- SVM
- Randomforest
- DecisionTree
- KNN(K nearest neighbors) 
- Logistic Regression

Those are most famous and popular algorithms in machine learning.Also **K-Fold Cross validation and normalization** are covered.


> 2. Movie Recommandation 

This project is one of the most popular machine learning project for beginner. We'll handle dataset called `Movie dataset`. This table contains `title`,`fil distributor`,`Genres` etc. And we have `ratings` which contains ratings information about each user with different moives. We'll use 3 different kind of algorithm to guess which movie recommandation would be proper for individual customers.

- Pearson correlation 
- Collaborative filtering
- Content based filtering
