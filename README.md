## Project overview 

1.Machine learning for beginner : Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients

[Orignianl dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/biomechanical-features-of-orthopedic-patients)

This is project is aimded to person who want to start machine learning with Kaggle competition. Acutally **Titatic Competition** is the
most popular kernal for beginner.But I think this dataset would be easiler to understand and handle machine learnining and data analysis.

2.Breast Cancer Study 

[Original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) 

This study is about different type of tumor with different informations. We'll use different informations as a sub_features or factors to predict if this patient would have a breast canacer. For prediction we'll use **sklearn**. There are algorithms in sklearn but we're going to apply following algorithms 

- SVM
- Randomforest
- DecisionTree
- KNN(K nearest neighbors) 
- Logistic Regression

Those are most famous and popular algorithms in machine learning.Also **K-Fold Cross validation and normalization** are covered.
