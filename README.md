## Project overview 

1. Everything about Machine learning for beginner : Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/biomechanical-features-of-orthopedic-patients)

This is project is aimded to person who want to start machine learning with Kaggle competition. Acutally **Titatic Competition** is the
most popular kernal for beginner.But I think this dataset would be easiler to understand and handle it.

The reason for that is following

> 1. Enough sub features for prediction 
Sometime there are too many features that people are hestiating which feature are they take for dataset. This kernel has only 6 sub features which means is perfect dataset for beginner 

> 2. Real world proejct : AI for Healtcare
AI is spreaded on most of industry field. Especially for **Healtcare** is the hottest topic currrently.This project is a introduction for them to understand about AI for Healtcare and from there beginner can dive deeper into the Machine learning and deep learning

2. Breast Cancer Study (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) 

This study is about different type of tumor with different informations. We'll use different informations as a sub_features or factors to predict if this patient would have a breast canacer. For prediction we'll use **sklearn**. There are algorithms in sklearn but we're going to apply following algorithms 

- SVM
- Randomforest
- DecisionTree
- KNN(K nearest neighbors) 
- Logistic Regression

Those are most famous and popular algorithms in machine learning.Also **K-Fold Cross validation and normalization** are covered.

3. Movie Recommandation (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) (updating)

This project is one of the most popular machine learning project for beginner. We'll handle dataset called `Movie dataset`. This table contains `title`,`fil distributor`,`Genres` etc. And we have `ratings` which contains ratings information about each user with different moives. We'll use 3 different kind of algorithm to guess which movie recommandation would be proper for individual customers.

- Pearson correlation 
- Collaborative filtering
- Content based filtering
